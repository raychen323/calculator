To run the program, call `stack run main`.  Our syntax is `d/d(var)(expression)`

Examples:
* d/dx(5+(3*x))
* d/dy(sin(y^2))

Our current plan for extra credit:
* We have extra constant rules to simplify constants
* We plan on making a GUI to let users input their expressions, and display the output.

# calculator

Austin Zhang and Raymond Chen

To run the program, call `stack run main`.  Our syntax is `d/d(var)(expression)` Make sure to explicity type every operation, and wrap in parentheses.

Examples:
* d/dx(5+(3*x))
* d/dy(sin(y^2))
* 5+(d/dx(5+3*x))

Extra Credit:
* We have extra constant rules to simplify constants
* We made a GUI which allows input and displays the answer and steps

Received help from Le Chang, Professor Joosten.

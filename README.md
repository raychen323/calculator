# calculator

Austin Zhang and Raymond Chen

To run the program, call `stack run main`.  Our syntax is `d/d(var)(expression)` Make sure to explicity type every operation and parentheses.

To run the GUI, call `stack run calculator-gui`. Our syntax for the GUI is the same as above. The window is resizable and you can type in equations by inputting in the bottom text field. Press = to run the calculator. To exit, just close the window.

Example Syntax:
* d/dx(5+(3*x))
* d/dy(sin(y^2))
* 5+(d/dx(5+3*x))

Extra Credit:
* We created extra constant rules to simplify constants (can apply operations to constants)
* We made a GUI which allows users to input expressions and displays the answer and steps

Received help from Le Chang, Professor Joosten.

# calculator

Austin Zhang and Raymond Chen

To run the program, call `stack run main`.  Our syntax is `derive(expression)` where expression is your following expression. Additionally for any operations, you must include the sign. For example, 5x is invalid, but 5*x is valid.

Our extra credit:

* We have extra constant rules to simplify constants
* We made a GUI which allows input and displays the answer and steps

Received help from Le Chang, Professor Joosten.
